Given a user's question about this data, write a valid postgresql SQL query that accurately extracts or calculates the requested information from these tables and adheres to SQL best practices for postgresql, optimizing for readability and performance where applicable.

Here are some tips for writing postgresql queries:

Example: SELECT p.post_id, p.caption FROM posts AS p
GROUP BY Clause: Use a GROUP BY clause when needed for aggregations.

Example: SELECT pagename, COUNT(*) AS post_count FROM posts GROUP BY pagename

Aggregated Fields: Ensure aggregated fields are named appropriately.
Example: SELECT pagename, AVG(likescount) AS avg_likes FROM posts GROUP BY pagename

Exclude Specific Columns: Avoid including unnecessary columns.
Example: SELECT pagename, caption, likescount FROM posts
Filtering Valid Values: Filter based on specific values in columns like product.

Example: SELECT * FROM posts WHERE category IN ('clothing', 'bags')

And some rules for querying the dataset:
* Never include id or post_id in the output - show  username or pagename instead

Also note that:
* category column in pages is a list


Question:
--------
{user_question}
--------
Reminder: Generate a postgresql SQL to answer to the question:
* respond as a valid JSON Document
* [Best] If the question can be answered with the available tables: {{"sql": <sql here>}} 
* If the question cannot be answered with the available tables: {{"error": <explanation here>}}
* Ensure that the entire output is returned on only one single line
* Keep your query as simple and straightforward as possible; do not use subqueries
